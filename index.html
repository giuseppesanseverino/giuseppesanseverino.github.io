  <h1>Welcome!</h1>
  <p>I am Giuseppe Sanseverino and I am a mecanichal engineer and a doctoral researcher at Sports Equipment and Technology department of Chemnitz University of Technology in Germany. 
  I am part of the Collaborative Research Centre "Hybrid Societies" which aims to investigate our future society, where humans and machines coexist.<br>
  My task in this big project, that includes many different young researchers from various fields, is to investigate Body-Attached Sensor Networks (BASN) for the recognition of gestures.
  I use virtual environment, digital twins and multibody simulation to build a framework capable of evaluating BASN and their boundary conditions (e.g. type, number and position of sensors).<br> 
  I am really passionate about cycling and sports. I conducted a research dealing with Hand-Arm Vibrations in road cycling and design process of innovative cycling gloves. <br> 
  This webpage will tell you a little bit more about me, my passions and the progress of my research.</p>
